    <!-- CSS stands for Cascading Style sheets, it is a file that HTML reads from top to bottom and applies rules to itself
    Every CSS rule consists of a few parts: 
        p{
            color: red; 
            font-size: 30px;
        }

        The P here is the selector - it tells HTML what to target, selectors come in 3 different flavors: 
        1) Tag select - targets all instances of an html, think of these as the default for your site 
        2) Class - .redFont - classes are reuseable lines of CSS, they apply anywhere you set an HTML element's class attribute, most common CSS selector
        Naming conventions for Classes - they are generally lowercase or camelCase 
        3) Id - #FrontPageHeader - these are meant to be used only once per page and generally exist to override other rules or do something that only appears once 
        Naming Conventions for Ids - They are always TitleCase 
        Given that Ids are meant to only once per page, they are the prefered for Javascript to interact with HTML 

        CSS Rules - css has countless built in rules, and you need to be to reference there's few you'll need frequent 
        - many rules especially the more complex ones are situational 
        Rules for: 
        1) Fonts - size, font family, boldness, alignment 
        2) Layout rules - box model - margin (space outside an element) 
                                      border - covers the edge of an element 
                                      padding - space between the border and heart of an element <- guess n check until it looks decent
        3) Sizing - width and height 

        Measurement in CSS 
        px - pixels on the screen roughly the same size on most screen 
        % - relative and its the % space of its parent element 
        
        em - complicated, but roughly correlates  with size of the M in your font <- we never use this 
        pt - mirror point sizes in MS word, generally too much size difference between points to be useful
